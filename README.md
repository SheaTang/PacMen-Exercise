# PacMen-Exercise:



# Description:
This exercise is a great example of `JavaScript` and `HTML` coming together. The Factory for PackMen exercise, is an interactive game that makes use of many callback functions: In the "game" many PackMen are moving and bouncing off-of the walls, each at different speeds. The user,  can add as many PacMen  as they wish by clicking the button functions in the upper right corner `Add PacMan` and `Start Game` . The button function `Add PacMan` calls `makePac()` which returns and object that is pushed into the `pacMen` array via `pacMen.push`.  Each PacMan, keeps track of its position and velocity as it moves across the screen (within the shadow DOM) using the function `setToRandom` ; the `checkCollisions` function allows it to update its position within the DOM via `setTimeoutâ€™ every 20 milliseconds.

# How to Run:
<li>Download the file from this GitHub Repository e.g. Clone this Repository,
<li>Open the index file in the console or your preferred code editor e.g. VS Code, 
<li>Run the project.

  
# Road Map of Future Improvements: 
<li>In the future I would add interactive functionality; via a full game,
<li>As I continue to add skills to my developer toolbox I will return to this project and update it.
